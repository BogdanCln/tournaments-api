Spring Boot REST API made for educational purpose - https://fmi.unibuc.ro/ 
___
Project scoring condition:

• No compilation errors present

• Implement the given requirements

• Clean code & Readability

• All tests passed

I. Define a system of your choice. Write a document in which you present:
1. all the functionalities of the application,
2. describe the entities (at least 6), the services,
3. the business requirements (at least 5)
4. any other details that you find important in order for someone to understand and
use this app.
II. The project should consist of a Spring Boot Application containing:
1. REST endpoints for all the main features defined (e.g. GET, POST, etc). You
should define at least 5 endpoints.
2. Define the beans for the services (implementing business logic). One service per
feature.
3. Define the beans for the repositories (e.g. insert, update, delete, read taking into
account different filters, constraints). One repository per entity.
4. Write unit tests and make sure all passed. Check the test coverage.
5. The data within the application should be persisted in a database. Define at least
the minimal number of entities requested and store them into the database. There
should be at least 3 relations between them (e.g. FK).
6. You should validate the POJO classes. You can use the existing validation
constraints or create your own annotations if you need a custom constraint.
7. Every API will be documented by Swagger. You can also export the visual
documentation and add it to your main document presentation.
8. The functionality of the application will be demonstrated using Postman or GUI
(Thymeleaf, Angular, etc).
